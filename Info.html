<h3><p><p align="center">Even though he may not seem typical in videos trust me, He’s sure he likes many of the same things you do. Ever since he was a young boy, He’s always enjoyed spending time outdoors with his family. He can remember going to locally held concerts during the summer months and He would have such a great time. He likes biking, walking, running, and loves warm sunny days. Outdoor BBQs and picnics are his all-time favourite things. As far as music goes, his style has been inspired by a mixture of modern pop and rap artists. He would say that the most influential artists have been Rebecca Black and the Cimorelli Band. They had taught him to pursue his dreams and do what he loves regardless of what people think. When he writes music, he always aims for unique interesting sounds to add pop and spice to his music.  Most importantly, he likes to keep tunes fresh and upbeat.</p></p></h3>

<p><p align="center">She really enjoys music because it inspires her to be a better person in life. She like music because it has the power to relive stress and it makes her have an extraordinary time.  After all, the most important thing is to keep cool and be yourself. She’s very particular when it comes to writing music since she wants it to reflect her best work. Even though she catches herself listening to almost any type of music, her favourite genres are pop and rap because she thinks that these genres really fit her way of life and personality. Her current favourite artists are Iggy Azalea and Jessie J. It’s not necessarily because of the lyrics but more because of the energy in the music that sticks in your head for a long time. When she sings she always likes to sing from the heart and with everything she’s got. She loves making music videos because it puts her in a very happy mood. Filming videos is great because she gets to travel and see many different places and it’s always a lot of fun. Speaking of travelling, one place where she would really love to visit one day is Paris. Who knows, one day she may find herself there making a music video!</p></p></3>

<p align="center">What’s there not to like about being in a family band while having fun making music? That pretty much sums up his motivation for doing what he does. Being able to create something positive and spending time together is pretty special. His interest in music started when his aunt and uncle bought him an electric guitar and a small amp for his ninth birthday. He immediately started plucking away at it making as many cool sounds as possible and that’s where his musical interest all started. Now he’s able to continue the experience and share his love of music with his kids. These moments will forever be in the songbook of my mind and years from now he will look back on them and have many fond memories. He likes listening to many different genres of music and feel that each style has something to offer. Being able to explore different musical ideas and having complete freedom to go wherever the mood takes him keeps the music fresh and distinctive. He is really looking forward to see where the next musical idea will take him.</p></h3>
